        <h2><b>SUMMARY</b></h2>
            <h3><p>
             I am Ilhan Sarı, born in Istanbul, and I have been stepping into the world of technology from an early age due to my interest in computers. My journey began with working on modeling applications in middle school and continued as I decided to focus on software during high school. After graduating from the Database Programming department, I interned as a full stack developer at a media agency. Currently, I am a second-year student in the Economics department, and my interest in blockchain technology encourages me to learn more about this field.
            Due to my experience working in various sectors, I am effective in team collaboration with my strong communication skills and proactive personality. I believe in the importance of using time efficiently and focus on hands-on learning experiences. I define myself as a professional open to continuous development, with the ability to quickly learn new programming languages. My hobbies include basketball, calisthenics, music, and drawing, which support my creativity and physical well-being.
