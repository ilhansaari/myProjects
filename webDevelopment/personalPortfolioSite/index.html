        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm İlhan, an economics student in Turkey. My interest in software began at an early age, and I’ve been working to continually improve myself in this field ever since. Over time, software became a true passion for me. To deepen this passion and build a community around it, I attended a technical high school, where I had the chance to explore different areas and expand my interests.

            In high school, I gained valuable experience by leading various projects and establishing strong connections with teachers and companies. Blockchain technology, still a new concept at the time, sparked my interest. Seeing how it bridges economics and software motivated me to pursue a place in this field, which ultimately led me to study economics.

            In my first year at university, I joined the management board of the Blockchain Student Society, allowing me to take a more active role in the industry. Later, with the goal of establishing a global community, I stepped down from the organization but continued to offer software training. Today, I remain focused on developing the community, creating projects in software and economics, writing blogs, and providing training.
